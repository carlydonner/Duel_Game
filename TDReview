There is still a lot of work to be done with the game. The primary thing I noticed was that the bulk of the efforts are first
being put into the sensors and what they will do for the game. This is the opposite approach that my partner
and I took to making the game which although does not mean one is more right then the other, but it may mean if you get stuck or
confused, maybe try coming in from the oppoiste side. The strategy we are taking is to get the game working with simple 
input from the keyboad and then eventually replace those key commands with sensor commands. This will allow an easy transition 
when the sensors are finally reintegrated. Additionally, although noted previously, your sprites are still not being used at the
moment. It may prove to be easier to use a simple block and then eventually replace that block with the sprite later in
the game development process. Not necessarily a must, but this method has proved helpful for us and may prove help to you as well.
